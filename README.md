<h1> Jamal's Weather App 1.0 Readme </h1>

Welcome to Jamal's Weather App 1.0. Here's how to use the app:<div class="0">
<br></br>
First, select a city which you would like to know the weather of from the top left tab.
If your city is not listed simply enter it in the boxes below the map and add it to the list.
Once added you can view the weather and a small map of the area that you have selected.
Remember:
<br></br>
<br></br>
1) <i>ADD</i> a city you would like using the boxes.
<br></br>
2) <i>MAPS</i> cannot be zoomed in yet. In a future version I may fix this.
<br></br>
3) <i>LOOK</i> at other cities in other states or countries to see what it's like there before traveling!
